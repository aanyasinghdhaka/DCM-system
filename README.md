# Case Priority Prediction Using AI

## Description
This project utilizes AI and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to predict the priority of legal cases based on their descriptions. It aims to enhance case management efficiency by categorizing cases into **High**, **Medium**, and **Low** priority tracks.

## Features
- **AI Model for Case Priority Prediction**: The AI model predicts the priority (**High**/**Medium**/**Low**) of legal cases by analyzing case descriptions.
  
- **Mobile App Integration**: Includes a user-friendly mobile app that allows stakeholders to track the status of predicted cases and receive updates on case progress.

- **NLP (BERT) for Case Analysis**: Utilizes BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), a state-of-the-art NLP model, to analyze and process case details for accurate priority prediction.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language used for model development and implementation.
  
- **TensorFlow**: Framework used for building and training the AI model.
  
- **Google Colab**: Cloud-based platform used for collaborative development and training of the AI model.
  
- **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)**: Pre-trained NLP model used for understanding and analyzing case descriptions.

## Achieved Accuracy
- The AI model has achieved an accuracy of **76%** in predicting case priorities based on a test dataset. This accuracy was validated through rigorous testing and cross-validation techniques.
